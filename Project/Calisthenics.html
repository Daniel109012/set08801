          <h3>What is calisthenics?</H3>
          <p>Calisthenics is a form of fitness which utilises gravity and bodyweight leverage to challenge your fitness level, is a form of strength training that uses the resistance of your body and gravity to help strengthen your muscles and improve your coordination, endurance and mobility. In fact, almost all common bodyweight exercises are calisthenics exercises such as squats, push-ups, lunges and crunches!</p>
          <p>Originally, calisthenics was a method of promoting health, ‘and thus securing beauty and strength’ in school children, but it’s evolved into a training method that shares a lot in common with gymnastics. Unlike gymnastics though, it can be practised outdoors and is known as a ‘street workout’.</p>
          <p>The best part about this versatile workout style is that you can do the exercises anytime, anywhere — from your at-home workout space to the gym, a hotel room, or even outdoors! Calisthenics exercises range from simple movements like squats or push ups that don’t require any equipment, to advanced movements</p>
          <p>One of the many benefits of this training style is you can get started without any equipment, which makes it a great form of strength training for beginners, perfect for at-home workouts and a great way to stay active.</p>

          <p></p>

          <h3>Advanced Calisthenics Exersices</h3>
          <p>As the Exersises get easier it is good to increase the intensity or add variations to make the Exersises more chalenging.</p>
