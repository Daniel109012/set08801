              <p>'Cardio', 'CV session' and 'cardiovascular workouts', are all common expressions referring to cardiovascular training. But what exactly is cardiovascular training and how much of it should you be doing?</p>
              <p>The dictionary definition for CV training is: ‘physical conditioning that exercises the heart, lungs and associated blood vessels’. In other words, when you do a cardio session, you’re giving your heart, lungs and circulatory system - in addition to any other muscle groups that you use - a good workout. Cardio exercise is extremely important because this system is effectively your body’s engine - and without a strong engine you’ll be going nowhere, no matter how good your bodywork is!</p>
              <h1 id="Legs" style="text-align: center;"></h1>


                <p>There are many different types of CV exercise, but the most effective CV exercises are those that use the largest muscle groups in the body and require you to support your own bodyweight while exercising. So, walking , jogging and running, while excellent fat burning exercise, are excellent for your CV workout because they fulfil both criteria: they use the large muscles of the legs and you have to stand up throughout your workout.</p>
