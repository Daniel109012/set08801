                <p>The barbell back squat is one of the most popular squat variations and makes up one of the three main powerlifting lifts. Using a barbell allows the squat to be loaded heavy, and also means you can increase the weight by smaller amounts to progress. It’s a great exercise for building both strength and hypertrophy, and a staple in many workouts.</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: To perform back squats, you’ll need a barbell and some weight plates, as well as a squat or power rack to hold the bar in. Other types of gym equipment that you may want to consider are knee sleeves, weightlifting shoes, and perhaps a weightlifting belt. </p>
                <div class="column-33">
                  <img src="Source/barbell-back-squat.png" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1 — Start by stepping under a barbell (supported in a squat rack), setting a firm foundation by flexing your core, and preparing to lift the barbell out of the rack. </p>
                <p>Step 2 — With your hands clasping the bar just outside your shoulders, take a breath and step out of the rack with the bar on your back.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Situate your feet in your squatting stance. If you aren’t sure, start by placing your feet just wider than your hips and turning your toes outward slightly.</p>
                <p>Step 4 — Take a new breath and think about expanding your core with air in all directions. Pick a spot directly in front of you and focus your gaze on it.</p>
                <p>Step 5 — Squat down by unlocking your knees and hips simultaneously and slowly sitting straight down. Keep your chest up, but allow your torso to lean forward as needed. Sink down until your hips drop below your knees, and then push through the floor to stand back up. </p>
              </div>

                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Romanian Dead Lifts (RDLs)</span></p>
                <p>The Romanian deadlift (RDL) is a traditional barbell lift used to develop the strength of the posterior chain muscles, including the erector spinae, gluteus maximus, hamstrings and adductors. When done correctly, the RDL is an effective exercise that helps strengthen both the core and the lower body with one move.</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: To perform RDL, you’ll need a barbell and some weight plates or dumbbells. Other types of gym equipment that you may want to consider are weightlifting shoes, and perhaps a weightlifting belt. </p>
                <p>The Romanian deadlift (RDL) should be a staple in (almost) everyone’s workout program. Whether your goals align with physique development, enhancement of athletic performance, or general health, we think the RDL is a tool worth having in your arsenal.</p>

              </div>
                <p> Step 1 — Position the barbell loaded with the appropriate number of weight plates directly in front of you on the floor, with an inch of space between your shins and the bar. Situate your feet underneath your hips and grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — As you grip the bar, tighten your entire back. Even though your upper back muscles don’t travel through a long range of motion, it’s crucial to engage them to keep a tight core and the bar close to your body. Deadlift the bar up to a standing position.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Shoot your hips backward. Begin leaning forward while keeping the bar close to your body with a flat back and your chest up. Maintain a slight bend in your knees. Continue to hinge your torso forward until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.</p>
                <p>Step 4 — Push your hips to the bar. As you move through the second half of the exercise, dig your legs into the ground, pull your chest up, and squeeze your glutes to bring your hips back to the bar to return to your upright position.</p>
                <p>Step 5 — Squat down by unlocking your knees and hips simultaneously and slowly sitting straight down. Keep your chest up, but allow your torso to lean forward as needed. Sink down until your hips drop below your knees, and then push through the floor to stand back up. </p>

              <div class="column-66">
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Leg Press</span></p>
                <p>The leg press is one of the best lower-body exercises out there. You’ll use a machine to help you drive quadriceps hypertrophy and improve squat strength. While the leg press is not a substitution for squatting, it can help beginners establish greater leg strength and growth.</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: To perform the Leg Press, you’ll need a Leg press machine. Other types of gym equipment that you may want to consider are weightlifting shoes, and perhaps a weightlifting belt. </p>
                <p>Specifically, the leg press targets the quadriceps muscles in the front of the thighs, the gluteal muscles in the buttocks, the hamstring muscles in the back of the thighs, and the calves, all in an integrated fashion.</p>
                <div class="column-33" >
                  <img src="Source/leg-press.png" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1 —  Sit into the seat and place your feet up against the sled plate in a comfortable, roughly hip-width stance. </p>
                <p>Step 2 — Unrack the weight sled using the handles by the sides of your hips. Once you have un-racked, bring your legs down into your chest and stomach so that your thighs break parallel and come as close to your body as possible.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Once you have reached a full depth in the leg press, press your feet through the footplate and lift the sled upwards. Be sure to not lose tension in your hips and core, keeping your hips and lower back on the seat.</p>

                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Barbell Row</span></p>
                <p>You won’t do much better than the barbell row when it comes to gaining back strength and size. Better yet, the strength you gain from rowing a heavy barbell in a hinged position carries over to the strength movements you love to do. You’ll also take your core and grip strength up a notch or three (but more on that below). Read up below for a step-by-step instructional on how to do the movement, plus variations, alternatives, and benefits explained. </p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: To perform back squats, you’ll need a barbell and some weight plates. Other types of gym equipment that you may want to consider are weightlifting shoes, and perhaps a weightlifting belt. </p>
                <div class="column-33">
                  <img src="Source/BBRow.png" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1 — Set Up: Stand upright with your feet under your hips and holding a barbell with a double-overhand grip just outside your thighs. </p>
                <p>Step 2 — Hinge Over: Tip over by pushing your butt backward while keeping your knees mostly straight, allowing the bar to slide down until it reaches around your kneecaps.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Pull: Brace your core, keep your back flat, and pull the bar up towards your lower abdomen. Keep your upper arms tucked tightly to your sides.</p>
                <p>Coach’s Tip: Maintain a consistent torso angle while you do the barbell row. The more upright you are, the less you’ll use the target muscles in your back. </p>

              <div class="column-66">
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Lateral Pull Downs</span></p>
                <p>As a strength athlete, you may have any number of goals. Sometimes, you want to increase strength. Other times, you’re focused on how to build muscle. Regardless of your goals, you’re going to need to develop a strong back. For this, finely-tuned accessory exercises come in handy to supplement your bigger lifts</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: Lat Pulldown Machine and Bar Attachment</p>
                <p>The lat pulldown is a compound exercise that will help you forge a stronger, wider back and help you take on your first pull-up. Because it is an overhead pull — performed with cable or a machine — it gives you a unique opportunity to develop your vertical pulling strength without performing a full pull-up. </p>
                <div class="column-33" >
                  <img src="Source/LatPullDown.png" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p>Step 1 — Take a medium-width, double-overhand grip on the bar, a few inches outside the shoulders. Make sure that the bar itself is resting in the middle of the palm, not in the fingertips. You can choose a thumbless grip or you can wrap your thumb around the bar.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — Sit down, making sure that your arms are fully extended and under load when seated to maximize the stretch on the lats. Your feet should be flat on the floor and your thighs situated snugly underneath the leg anchoring pad. Think about flaring your lats out as you reach overhead.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Sit up as tall as you can, feeling the stretch on the lats and triceps. With your chest up and back arched, pull the bar down to your chin level. As you pull down, try to minimize leaning back. Think about driving your elbows down towards your back pockets.</p>
                <p>Step 4 — Let your arms go back overhead with control. Make sure to feel a big stretch and tension on the lats. Pause in this fully-stretched position, and repeat for more repetitions.</p>
                <p>Why Do It: By isolating your back, lat pulldowns also help improve your back hypertrophy because your knees are held down by the pad you put your thighs under. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="column-66">
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Seated Cable Row</span></p>
                <p>A strong back says a lot about your training. Since you need a strong back for heavy pulling, pressing, and everything in between, it makes sense to train your back. The seated cable row is a back isolation exercise that can be a great exercise to increase back size, strength and improve your back’s ability to stay strong under heavy loads. </p>
                <p>Because it is a horizontal pull — performed with cables or a machine — the seated cable row gives you the opportunity to develop your horizontal pulling strength. But with this move, you don’t add extra stress to the lower back (unlike bent-over barbell rows). It’s also not limited by hamstring flexibility. While other rowing movements certainly have their place in a good training program, there are a lot of benefits to isolated rowing movements where you don’t need to support your lower back or hold yourself in bent-over positions.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="column-33" >
                  <img src="Source/SeatedCableRow.png" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1 — Set Yourself Up
                  Start by taking a seat on the bench, facing the cable stack. Grab the handles. Extend your legs so your hips are far back on the bench. Bend your knees slightly with a flat lower back. Allow your upper torso to lean forward slightly.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — Stabilize and Pull 
                  With your body set up and arms extended in front of you, pull your elbows back. Don’t lean back too far or let your back lose its arch as you pull the weight back into your body.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Reach Forward and Repeat
                  Once you have contracted your back muscles, reach forward. Allow your torso to move forward slightly, aiming for another big stretch in your back. Repeat this process for reps.</p>

                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Barbell Bench Press</span></p>
                <p>The bench press is for everyone, but certain athletes approach the movement differently. If you’re a bodybuilder or just hitting the gym to get in better shape, the steps below should serve you nicely. </p>
                <p>The Bench Press can also be done using either the Barbell or a pair of Dumbbells</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: Most gyms have a dedicated incline bench press station, but to perform the exercise you can also roll an adjustable weight bench into a squat rack.  </p>
                <div class="column-33">
                  <img src="Source/BBbenchpress.jpg" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1: Start by firmly planting your feet on the floor with your knees bent. Arch your back and ensure that your buttocks and upper back are firmly in contact against the bench. Make sure that your scapulas are pinched together and compressed.  </p>
                <p>Step 2: Establish full-body tension by inhaling deeply and actively pressing your feet into the floor. The barbell should be roughly over your eyes. From here, hold your breath and “pull” the bar out of the rack such that it ends up directly over your shoulders.</p>
                <p>Step 3: With the barbell directly over your shoulders, break at the elbows and lower it down toward your chest. The point of contact depends on your anatomy and grip width — if you have short arms or a close grip, you’ll generally make contact with the bar lower on your chest.</p>
                <p>Step 4: Once the barbell touches your chest, pause briefly and aggressively drive it back to the starting position. The barbell should move up and back towards your head, so your shoulders, elbows, and wrists are all aligned vertically. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="column-66">
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Inclined Bench Press</span></p>
                <p>The incline barbell bench press targets slightly different muscles than the standard flat bench. By adjusting your bench press form slightly and working on an inclined surface, you’ll involve your triceps and front deltoids to a greater degree. You’ll also shift emphasis from your pecs as a whole to your upper chest specifically. </p>
                <p>The Bench Press can also be done using either the Barbell or a pair of Dumbbells</p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: Most gyms have a dedicated incline bench press station, but to perform the exercise you can also roll an adjustable weight bench into a squat rack. </p>

              </div>
                <p>Step 1 — Set the bench seat between a 20- and 40-degree incline.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — Grab the bar with the same grip you’d use on the flat bench press.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Then, unrack the barbell and lower it toward your chest as far as possible.</p>
                <p>Modifications: The higher the angle of the bench, the more difficult the exercise becomes because load shifts almost entirely onto your shoulders. You may also struggle to press comfortably from a high incline if you aren’t used to it. </p>
              </div>

              <div class="column-66">
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Dumbbell Flyes</span></p>
                <p>isolation movements like the dumbbell flye are a great way to activate your pecs and keep your upper body functional and proportional all at once. The flye looks like a beginner’s movement, but that doesn’t mean it’s not useful for gymgoers of any level.</p>
                <p>Flyes aren’t a primary strength exercise; however, they can be useful within the scope of a full workout routine if you program them properly. You’ll need to find a weight that allows you maintain control over the movement from start to finish, but still provides a nasty burn and a big pump to your pecs.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="column-33" >
                  <img src="Source/DumbbellFlyes.jpg" style="width:100%; object-fit: cover;">
              </div>
                <p> Step 1 — Set Up
                  Start by lying on a bench with the dumbbells extended so that your hands are stacked directly over your shoulders. Turn your palms in so they face each other. Keep your shoulder blades squeezed and in contact with the bench for the entire duration of the movement.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — Open Up
                  Bend your elbows slightly and keep them at a consistent angle throughout the movement. Then, slowly lower the dumbbells out to the side until your arms are parallel with the floor and your pecs are significantly stretched. Pause at the bottom briefly. </p>
                <p>Step 3 — Draw Your Arms Together
                  From the bottom position, smoothly reverse the motion. Maintain that same slight bend in your elbows as you return to the starting position. </p>

                <p>The word biceps may well invoke thoughts of watching your biceps swell in the mirror with every rep. Whether you want bulging shirt sleeves or just a strong pair of biceps to bolster your pulling strength, building a big barbell biceps curl is a rite of passage.</p>
                <p>The barbell biceps curl will allow you to go even heavier than the dumbbell and cable variations. Since you’re using the most weight, you’ll be flirting with better biceps gains.</p>
                <p>The standard barbell curl with an underhand grip is a classic that never goes out of style. This variation targets biceps and forearms and can add a huge amount of size and strength to your upper arms.                </p>
                <p>Equipment Needed: Barbell and weights</p>

                <p> How to Do the Barbell Biceps Curl</p>
                <p>Grip the barbell with an underhand grip around shoulder-width apart. Keep your chest up and your shoulder blades down and back. With your upper arms by your sides, curl the barbell up, using your biceps while ensuring an upright posture. Lower back to the starting position and repeat.</p>

                <p>You can build big muscles with small movements. That’s a fact. While large, compound lifts should be your bread and butter as a bodybuilder, carving out the finest details of your physique requires equally-precise exercise choices. </p>
                <p>The triceps brachii is a three-headed muscle that’s involved in two primary actions.
                  The first is extending, or straightening, the elbow. The second is helping pull the arm down from an overhead or front-of-body position (shoulder extension). Additionally, the triceps are important stabilizers in the shoulder joints.</p>
                <p>overhead tricep extensions are an excellent way to target all three heads, and a great exercise to add to your fitness routine.</p>

                <p>Step 1 — Hold the weight overhead by grasping the inside dumbbell plate surface with both hands, or by grasping both handles of the kettlebell.</p>
                <p>Step 2 — Slowly bend your elbows and lower the weight behind your head as far as you can. Remember to keep your trunk upright and your core engaged. The weight should follow the path of your spine.</p>
                <p>Step 3 — Then, at the lowest point, straighten your elbows and extend the weight back overhead. Hold the fully extended position for a moment, then repeat. Keep the movement slow and controlled.</p>
                <p>Choose a weight that’s challenging but allows you to use good form. Keep the speed of the movement slow and steady.</p>

                <p>Since the chest Exersices also target the Front Delts, this will summarize the lateral raise which targets the mid Delt and rear Delts. </p>
                <p><span style="font-size:25px">Lateral Raises</span></p>
                
                <p>There are few muscles that are exemplary both in a t-shirt and on the beach, but an impressive pair of deltoids are one of them. The lateral raise can be tricky to perfect, but, when mastered, becomes the cornerstone of a boulder-shoulder aesthetic. While visually straightforward, there are subtle tidbits that can greatly improve your results and help you craft massive delts that both look good and perform powerfully. </p>
                <p>Lateral raises hit the middle part of the deltoids which give the bulky rounded appearanc from the front.</p>

                <p> Step 1: Stand Tall - Stand tall or shift the hips back ever so slightly (using a hip hinge). Take a neutral grip on the dumbbells and bend the arm just enough to keep the elbow joint from being fully locked out. Instead of tucking your arm at your side, allow it to drift forward slightly. Brace your legs, core, and trunk to provide preliminary stability. </p>
                <p>Step 2: Raise the Weights - Keep your palms facing your body with a neutral grip and raise the dumbbells towards the sides or your body until your arms are roughly parallel to the ground. Stop just before the dumbbells elevate higher than your clavicles. </p>
                <p>Step 3: Reset and Repeat - If possible, pause for a brief moment at the top of the repetition. This will create an additional stability demand and increase the challenge of the movement. </p>
                <p>Lower the dumbbells under control to avoid loss of position or the addition of momentum between repetitions. </p>

                <p><span style="font-size:25px">reverse Flyes</span></p>
                <p>The reverse fly is an exercise you can do with dumbbells to target the muscles in the upper back. During a reverse fly, you work the rhomboid muscles in your upper back and shoulder region. Strong upper back muscles help balance your shoulder strength and help protect your shoulder from injury.</p>
                <p>The reverse cable fly is a great exercise to add to your upper body routine if you want to work on your rear deltoids, rotator cuff, and trapezius. It can help you improve your posture, balance your shoulder development, and add variety to your training.</p>

                <p>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides. Press the hips back in a hinge motion, bringing your chest forward and almost parallel to the floor. Let the weights hang straight down (palms facing each other) while maintaining a tight core, straight back, and slight knee bend.</p>
                <p> Step 1: Raise both arms out to your side on an exhale. Keep a soft bend in your elbows. Squeeze the shoulder blades together as you pull them toward the spine.</p>
                <p>Step 2: Lower the weight back to the start position as you inhale. Avoid hunching your shoulders, and keep your chin tucked to maintain a neutral spine during the exercise.</p>
                <p>Lower the dumbbells under control to avoid loss of position or the addition of momentum between repetitions.</p>
