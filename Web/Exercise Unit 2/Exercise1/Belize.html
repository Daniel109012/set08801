			<h2>Belize Central America</h2>
			<p>Tucked between the Caribbean Sea and the rainforest on the eastern coast of Central America, Belize is the home of a small and diverse nation.

The country, formerly known as British Honduras, was the United Kingdom's last colony on the American mainland and still maintains strong ties with Britain.</p>

<p>Today Belize, which considers itself part of both the Caribbean and Central America, is cultivating relations with Latin America and the United States, 
although there is a lingering dispute with neighbouring Guatemala, which has made claim to part of Belize's territory in the past.</p>

<p>Tourism is a major source of foreign currency. Belize's attractions include wildlife, Mayan ruins and one of the longest barrier reefs in the world.
